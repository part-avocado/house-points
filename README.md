This is a boolean function that switches between TRUE and FALSE. (any other input will absolutely destory the system :). In the event that TRUE is passed, the normal display is shown. However, in the event that FALSE is presented, a custom display writing "Something big happening" and the default message (from H21) will be placed in big text. <br> This can be useful when you want to hide some data (like big mixup) and gets updated along the others once every 15 minutes.
